        To summarize, the . operator concatenates strings and variables. Itâ€™s important to ensure that variable names are used correctly and consistently because PHP is case-sensitive.

        
        The use of . for concatenation in the first two echo statements and the direct variable interpolation in the third echo statement are both valid ways to include variable values within strings in PHP.
